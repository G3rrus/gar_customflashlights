# G4rrus' Custom Flashlights
## Description
This mod adds a few "stronger" variants of the vanilla flashlight to the arsenal. That's all there is to it.

## Requirements:
This mod relies on the following mods:
* CBA_A3: https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3

## Installation:
Just load this mod together with CBA_A3 and you should be able to use the flashlights like and other weapon attachement.

### FAQ:
Q: Is there anyway you can fix that the flashlights look much stronger on others than on yourself?\
A: No, if you haven't noticed it's also a problem with the vanilla flashlight, it's just less obvious because it's so weak to begin with.

Q: Can you please make "X" variant of the flashlight?\
A: No, but you can open a PR and I'll check it out, if I like it a lot I'll add it.

Q: Why can't I find the flashlights in the editor?\
A: Because I haven't added them to be available in the editor.
